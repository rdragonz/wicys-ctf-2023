Challenges I submitted to the WiCyS CTF competition for 2023

Each folder has another README inside that explains the challenge, gives a hint, and gives the "intended" solution, although multiple correct sollutions do exist for each.

These files are not under any license, however I personally ask that you do not distribute these files anywhere else or re-use them for anything else. They're provided purely for educational purposes.
